# Placementor

Mailer Daemon is the best recognised student-run media body of IIT (ISM) Dhanbad. Our pages have produced exhaustive reports and statistics every day for the last two decades, helping the student community express their opinions, identify opportunities and stay updated with news and ideas centred around the college.

'Placementor' is another initiative towards the same: creating a compendium of valuable insights, data and statistics to help you clinch your dream job.

Students appear for placements in the final year of their study, with the CDC following a One-Student-One-Job policy.

This version of placementor uses ReactJS+Sanity.io
